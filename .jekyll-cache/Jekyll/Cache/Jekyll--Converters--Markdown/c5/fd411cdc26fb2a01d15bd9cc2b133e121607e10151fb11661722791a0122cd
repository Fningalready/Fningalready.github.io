  <li>Flower Tip 1: Wit</li>
</ul>

<p>Asters were chosen as a tribute to the first missionary in Ethiopia, Plumatius. For his time, Flumetias was a man of great wit, and it was with his wit that he went to the pagan countries to accomplish the difficult task of missionary persuasion. So the word for asters is – wit.

Mosquitoes seem to like the smell of smoke, so its flower word is “lie”. Those blessed with these flowers are good liars. However, does not represent what malicious, but he does not have confidence in interpersonal relations, so that inadvertently will want to say, repeatedly modified after the expression, please be sure to try the taste of true love yo, you will find that after paying sincerity, you can make you have the confidence to communicate with people.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

He who is blessed by this flower always thinks that he has something of the nobility in him. You are outstanding in your knowledge and upbringing, but a little negative in your personality. If you can be positive, you will be an asset to the tiger, and those who adore you will look upon you with respect.
