<h3 id="5-chrysanthemum">5. Chrysanthemum</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While Chrysanthemums are symbolic of many of the very postive meanings above, such as joy, love and beauty, scholarly isolation is another, perhaps slightly negative meaning of ‘mums’ (as many people often call them colloquially). Nevertheless, this makes them a great gift to congratulate or encourage someone with their studies. This is equally relevant as they are also considered great flowers to wish someone luck with their work or for an upcoming project. They are also the official flower for Mother’s day in Australia (once again due to the ‘mums’ nickname)[5].</li>
  <li>In some parts of Europe however, Chrysanthemums can also be symbolic of death, and are exclusively used to decorate the graves of dearly departed relatives at funerals. So be very careful where you send your ‘mums’ as in some European countries this could be inappropriate as a romantic or celebratory gift[5].</li>
