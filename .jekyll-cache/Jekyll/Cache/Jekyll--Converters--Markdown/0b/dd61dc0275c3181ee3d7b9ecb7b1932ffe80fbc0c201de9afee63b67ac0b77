<p>Flowers have been used for centuries in many European and Asian countries and have even played an important role in literature, from the sonnets, which show us the gardens Shakespeare travelled through, to the myth of Shennong tasting a hundred herbs in ancient times, when flowers had their own meaning and were even used as medicine. Almost every emotion can be expressed in flowers, for example a red rose means ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.</p>

<p>Learning about the special symbolism of flowers became a popular pastime in the 1800s. It helped us to express ourselves in a subtle way and it can help us to express our feelings of disgust.</p>
