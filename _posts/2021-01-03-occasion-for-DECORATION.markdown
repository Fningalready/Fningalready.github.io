### 2. Amaryllis
* The desire to be loved, the courageous pursuit of love, and also to express their weak desire to be cared for.
* The Victorians associated amaryllis with strength and determination because of its height and solidity.
* Ornamental plant.

### 4. Aster
* Symbol of Love, Daintiness  
* For viewing. This species is a genuine product of aster, root medicine treating chronic bronchitis, cough, phlegm.
* It can be used in many places—borders, rock gardens, or wildflower gardens, to name a few.

### 5. Chrysanthemum
* While Chrysanthemums are symbolic of many of the very postive meanings above, such as joy, love and beauty, scholarly isolation is another, perhaps slightly negative meaning of ‘mums’ (as many people often call them colloquially). Nevertheless, this makes them a great gift to congratulate or encourage someone with their studies. This is equally relevant as they are also considered great flowers to wish someone luck with their work or for an upcoming project. They are also the official flower for Mother’s day in Australia (once again due to the ‘mums’ nickname).
* In some parts of Europe however, Chrysanthemums can also be symbolic of death, and are exclusively used to decorate the graves of dearly departed relatives at funerals. So be very careful where you send your ‘mums’ as in some European countries this could be inappropriate as a romantic or celebratory gift.

### 6. Sweet Woodruff
* Sweet woodruff may not work well in most bouquets and vase arrangements, but any gardener or herb enthusiast would love to receive these special plants as a gift.
