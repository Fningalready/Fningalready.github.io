* Flower Tip 1: Wit

Asters were chosen as a tribute to the first missionary in Ethiopia, Plumatius. For his time, Flumetias was a man of great wit, and it was with his wit that he went to the pagan countries to accomplish the difficult task of missionary persuasion. So the word for asters is -- wit.

* Flower Tip 3: Aristocratic taste

In the south of France in the 12th century, enough to represent the noble family saint Dirufina, he praised the flower is aster flower, so its flower language is from saint Dirufina's "noble interest". He who is blessed by this flower always thinks that he has something of the nobility in him. You are outstanding in your knowledge and upbringing, but a little negative in your personality. If you can be positive, you will be an asset to the tiger, and those who adore you will look upon you with respect.
