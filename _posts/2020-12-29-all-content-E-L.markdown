### Edelwelss

* The unique furry petals and leaves of the Edelweiss hint at its romantic meaning, but it’s the white color that gives it the symbolism of purity and innocence. It is widely used as a symbol of rugged individualism and exploring the wilderness due to its growth in the high altitudes of the Alps.
<br>

* Edelweiss is not widely used as a fresh cut flower in bouquets, but it is often given as a gift in dried form. Dried Edelweiss are great for commemorating a visit to the Alps or Austria and Switzerland. 
<br>

* As a symbolic gift, it can also inspire someone’s adventurous side or indicate your romantic devotion. Even Edelweiss themed gifts are good for sending a clear message of how you feel to someone.
